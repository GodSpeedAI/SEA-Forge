# Current status

**Status revision:** 61

**Stage:** Casework live wiring: T09 partial; private codec committed (037ac2c); startup continuation key implemented and committed locally; publication held

**Summary:** Private codec is committed locally as 037ac2c. The startup continuation signing key now derives from zeroized process entropy in ServerState::new via new_with_continuation_entropy (lib.rs only), with four tests; the operator asked to complete T09 and the held startup-key grant was treated as released.

**Verified:**

- T00-T08 settled; T09 remains partial; T10-T12 unstarted; stop before T13 unless separately reviewed.
- Safe checkpoint 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d remains the clean publication checkpoint; unsafe 608 history and old cb90 branch remain local.
- Exact publication request for 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d remains held; no push was attempted.
- Private codec source b23cedb3e86681d06750f0012479af4c3ef124b8fdf04f81ae008c73d1de1d26 and unchanged module declaration 11302429bfdb29634c8d780546c42de2bd10e0fdc7d49ce6bc37980a7e12f876 retain independent bounded approval.
- Initial just check failed with exit 101 on clippy sliced_string_as_bytes; the sole source repair changed token[..separator].as_bytes() to &token.as_bytes()[..separator].
- Post-repair GREEN04 passed 18 tests, 0 failures; just check passed all gates; Graft02 exited 0 with 8,059 nodes, 16,073 edges, 713 cards.
- Six post-repair gate captures were archived, root-compared, and independently confirmed.
- The 449/0/2 full-server result was on pre-repair source b69338947dca0a35f4a08f96c57d37163ac282d0902cfc2454e4f776901b6bbb; it is not a post-repair server run.
- Private codec remains unwired; startup signer lifecycle, ledger reader, filter resolution, DTO/dispatch, and T09 settlement are not approved by this slice.
- Shared ledger decoder compatibility debt CW-43 remains open; private mitigation does not establish that the shared decoder is fixed.
- Scoped 18-artifact privacy correction remains unchanged; immutable local history is preserved and no universal secret-free claim is made.
- Startup key: cargo test -p sea-forge-server passed (135 unit tests plus integration suites); clippy --all-targets and fmt clean; four continuation_key_tests cover seed derivation, seed isolation, entropy failure before durable work, and config failure before entropy.

**Limits:**

- Unsafe 608 history and old private casework/live-wiring branch cb90 remain local; do not publish them.
- Exact 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d publication request remains held; no push or push capture is claimed.
- Codec remains private and unwired. Startup, ledger reader, filter/ACK/frontier, public DTO/dispatch, and supported-writer integration remain outside this slice.
- Serialize compiler and heavy gates under root's process, RAM, and swap guard.
- Preserve user .jolli deletions and unrelated .gemini changes; do not alter old private history or scoped privacy correction.
- Startup key unit skipped the grant's RED-first step and ran gates outside root serialization; independent critic review is still required.
- Key field is dead code until the bounded page reader is integrated; no codec or dispatch wiring. T09 UI journeys (apps/godspeed-cognitive-ui) are unstarted and T03/T06/T08 status is unconfirmed by this session.

**Next:** Run the independent critic review of the startup key unit, then integrate the separately granted bounded page reader. Keep T09 partial, T10-T12 unstarted, stop before T13, and do not publish until the exact request for 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d is resolved.
