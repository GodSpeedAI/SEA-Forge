**Status revision:** 60

**Stage:** Casework live wiring: T09 partial; private codec approved and workspace checked; local commit pending; publication held

**Summary:** Safe checkpoint 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d remains the clean publication checkpoint; unsafe 608 history stays excluded and old cb90 remains private. Approved private codec source is b23cedb3e86681d06750f0012479af4c3ef124b8fdf04f81ae008c73d1de1d26 after the single-expression clippy repair; module declaration 11302429bfdb29634c8d780546c42de2bd10e0fdc7d49ce6bc37980a7e12f876 is unchanged. GREEN04 passed 18 tests, just check passed all gates, and Graft02 passed (8,059 nodes, 16,073 edges, 713 cards); captures were archived and independently confirmed. Earlier full-server result (449 passed, 0 failed, 2 ignored) was on pre-repair source b69338947dca0a35f4a08f96c57d37163ac282d0902cfc2454e4f776901b6bbb. A normal local codec commit is pending. No push occurred; codec remains private and unwired. T09 remains partial; T10-T12 unstarted; stop before T13.

**Verified:**

- T00-T08 settled; T09 remains partial; T10-T12 unstarted; stop before T13 unless separately reviewed.
- Safe checkpoint 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d remains the clean publication checkpoint; unsafe 608 history and old cb90 branch remain local.
- Exact publication request for 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d remains held; no push was attempted.
- Private codec source b23cedb3e86681d06750f0012479af4c3ef124b8fdf04f81ae008c73d1de1d26 and unchanged module declaration 11302429bfdb29634c8d780546c42de2bd10e0fdc7d49ce6bc37980a7e12f876 retain independent bounded approval.
- Initial just check failed with exit 101 on clippy sliced_string_as_bytes; the sole source repair changed token[..separator].as_bytes() to &token.as_bytes()[..separator].
- Post-repair GREEN04 passed 18 tests, 0 failures; just check passed all gates; Graft02 exited 0 with 8,059 nodes, 16,073 edges, 713 cards.
- Six post-repair gate captures were archived, root-compared, and independently confirmed.
- The 449/0/2 full-server result was on pre-repair source b69338947dca0a35f4a08f96c57d37163ac282d0902cfc2454e4f776901b6bbb; it is not a post-repair server run.
- Private codec remains unwired; startup signer lifecycle, ledger reader, filter resolution, DTO/dispatch, and T09 settlement are not approved by this slice.
- Shared ledger decoder compatibility debt CW-43 remains open; private mitigation does not establish that the shared decoder is fixed.
- Scoped 18-artifact privacy correction remains unchanged; immutable local history is preserved and no universal secret-free claim is made.

**Limits:**

- Unsafe 608 history and old private casework/live-wiring branch cb90 remain local; do not publish them.
- Exact 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d publication request remains held; no push or push capture is claimed.
- Authorized normal local codec commit is pending; do not claim T09 completion or public readiness.
- Codec remains private and unwired. Startup, ledger reader, filter/ACK/frontier, public DTO/dispatch, and supported-writer integration remain outside this slice.
- Serialize compiler and heavy gates under root's process, RAM, and swap guard.
- Preserve user .jolli deletions and unrelated .gemini changes; do not alter old private history or scoped privacy correction.

**Next:** Make the authorized normal local codec commit. Then proceed under the existing held startup-continuation-key grant; next scoped implementation is the bounded reader and dispatch. Keep T09 partial, T10-T12 unstarted, stop before T13, and do not publish until the fresh exact request for 552bd655ba53b2c46d15e0c61624a57c58143b5d is resolved.
