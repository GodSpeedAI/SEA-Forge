# Observed Debt

Record concrete debt, gaps, risks, or defects found while working but outside
the current task. Each entry needs evidence, impact, and a next move. Remove an
entry when resolved; do not use this file as a backlog of ideas.

<!-- Entry format:
## Open: Short problem statement
- Observed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Evidence: file, line, command, or failing proof
- Impact: concrete cost or risk
- Next move: smallest credible resolution
- Scope: why it was not fixed in the discovering task
-->

## Open: Historical frontend planning documents fail repository-wide diff whitespace checks

- Observed: 2026-07-24
- Evidence: `git diff --check 02ed18d..HEAD` reports trailing whitespace in
  `.agents/plans/DEV_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` and several
  `.agents/specs/frontend/*.md` files; `git diff --check` for Task 19's own
  changes is clean.
- Impact: broad historical-range reviews produce noisy whitespace failures and
  can hide a new formatting defect in the same output.
- Next move: normalize only those documentation files in a dedicated
  formatting commit after confirming intentional Markdown hard breaks.
- Scope: the files are pre-existing committed frontend/planning work unrelated
  to Task 19's conformance claims; changing them would expand this closeout.
